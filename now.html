  <h2>Now Now Now</h2>
  <p>This year is all about <b>distributed data</b>, their organisation and protection and safety. Aside from <b>leading the development of the cross-platform core SDK</b> at <a href="http://www.immmr.com/">immmr</a> using CouchDB, I am volunteering with <a href="https://safenetwork.org/">SafeNetwork</a>, a self-encrypted, fully distributed, open-source, peer-to-peer internet with privacy built-in.</p>
  <p>Further I am getting deeper into <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a>, a memory safe systems programming language and am co-organising the first <b>Rust Conference</b> on european soil â€“ <a href="http://www.rustfest.eu/">RustFest</a> in September in Berlin. I organise and coach with <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org/">OpenTechSchool Berlin</a> and curate <a href="http://www.arewewebyet.org/">AreWeWebYet</a></p>
  <p>
    I am also in the process of relocating my center of living to beautiful <b>Amsterdam</b>, joining the <a href="https://embassynetwork.com/locations/ams/">local Embassy Coliving Space</a>. So, if you want to get something awesome started in AMS, like a Rust-Meetup or OpenTechSchool Events, hit me up!
