  pitch: "Reimaging ERP for mid-sized companies, based on an offline-first document store system."
  desc: "All existing ERPs are complexity overkill for small- and mid-sized organisations. With this offline-first completly frontend-logic website on top of couchdb, we experimented with a different approach of a simplistic document store. As couchdb doesn't allow server-side execution, many microservices in the back allowed for minimal tasks, like document generation and emailing."
