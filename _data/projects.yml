  desc: "All existing ERPs are complexity overkill for small- and mid-sized organisations. With this offline-first completly frontend-logic website on top of couchdb, we experimented with a different approach of a simplistic document store. As couchdb doesn't allow server-side execution, many microservices in the back allowed for minimal tasks, like document generation and emailing."

  desc: "Moving Germany's second biggest general question-answer-community off its 15yr old perl-script and onto a discourse-based rewrite. Trying to keep the changes to core to a minimum and implement everything as plugins, which can ultimately be outsourced. Most famously, the [tagger](#tagger)-plugin, [questions-plugin](https://github.com/ligthyear/discourse-plugin-questions), [sidebar](https://github.com/ligthyear/discourse-plugin-sidebar), [profile notes](https://meta.discourse.org/t/private-profile-notes/12794). Aside from the obvious changes to the design, and support for multiple archetypes (including video on kaltura) With its over 5Mio post, it is probably the largest discourse installation to date, which required further performance improvements in postrgresql and changes like using elastic search for search."

Thus allowing for plugins to ship template changes which would be integrated _at compile time_. Fast and pretty, unfortunately hard to maintain as every chnage to the file meant you needed new patches."
